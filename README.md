# EDA-Project---Hotel-Booking-Analysis

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on 'Hotel Bookings.' It consists of several columns such as hotel name, lead time, customer type, distribution channels, market segment, and many more, each containing various pieces of information about hotel bookings. In this project, I will utilize different libraries to clean and filter the data, making it easier to visualize and understand.
